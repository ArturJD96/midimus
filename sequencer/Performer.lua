    Class: T R A C K

    A performer able to play out sequence.

    This object is responsible for correctly performing
    a sequence by progressing it's events through time
    by correct time intervals in a chosen manner
    (forwards, backwards etc). It remembers the previously
    played event so it can resume playing after being stopped.
